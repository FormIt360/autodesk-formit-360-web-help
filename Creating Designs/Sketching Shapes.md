# Sketching Shapes

Use Lines, Arcs, Splines, Rectangles, and Circles to create foundational shapes for your building designs.

After selecting a drawing tool, you can hover anywhere on the canvas and use snaps and inference points as you place your first and subsequent points.

## Sketching Lines

1. Click once in the drawing area to place the first endpoint of the line.
2. Use snapping and/or inference lines to locate and place the second endpoint of the line.
3. To draw the next line segment, you will need to click to create another endpoint.

Once you start drawing a line on an axis, pressing Shift locks the line to that axis so that you can extend it without worrying about leaving the axis.

Use the Tab key to open the Set Length dialog that allows you to type in a length value. When Snap to Grid is turned off, the values in the Set Length box appear in whole numbers; with Snap to Grid on, the numbers appear in fractions of a foot or meter. Any time a temporary dimension string is on the screen, Tab will allow you to edit the most recently entered dimension.

## Sketching 3-Point Arcs

1. Click once in the drawing area to place the first endpoint of the arc.
2. Use snapping and/or inference lines to locate and place the second endpoint of the arc.
3. Click once more to set the bulge dimension of the arc.

1. Click once in the drawing area to place the first endpoint of the arc.
2. Use snapping and/or inference lines to locate and place the second endpoint of the arc.
3. Click once more to set the bulge dimension of the arc.

## Sketching Splines

1. Click your mouse once you are ready to place the first endpoint of the spline.
2. Follow the same steps of hover, snap / inference, click - to draw the next spline point.
NoteThe spline curve appears automatically.
1. ![](Images/GUID-7F769709-6434-40BF-BB18-2C7C73E343C6-low.png)Click the original spline end point to close the loop of sketch lines and create a plane.

## Sketching Rectangles

1. Click your mouse once you are ready to place the first corner of the rectangle.
2. Follow the same steps of hover, snap/inference, click - to place the second corner of the rectangle.
3. ![](Images/GUID-8D08B9BE-B846-4FBA-9CEC-9A8E653548C0-low.png)Finally, follow the same steps as before to place the third corner of the rectangle.

## Sketching Circles

![](Images/GUID-1193F05F-06CC-4415-A8E8-809D5824D25D-low.png) 
1. Click your mouse once you are ready to place the center point of the circle.
2. ![](Images/GUID-E665F344-1E0F-41B0-8195-EC68951CAC69-low.png)Follow the same steps of hover, snap/inference, click - to define the radius of the circle.
