# Modify Designs

Make designs more complex by using a variety of geometry modification tools.
 

After you select an object (solid, face, edge, point), you can manipulate objects using a variety of operations including Move, Delete, Extrude, Offset, Tilt, Scale, Rotate, Array, and Boolean operations like Union and Subtract.
