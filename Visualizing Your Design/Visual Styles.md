# Visual Styles

Visual Styles provides a one-stop shop for tweaking the display of a model's surfaces, edges, and its environment. Visual Styles also provides options for toggling helpful diagnostic options.

##Surfaces

- **Shadows:** Display shadows based on sketch location and selected time of day.
- **Ambient Shadows:** Display soft shadows for an added touch of realism.
- ** Monotone Surfaces:** Display all surfaces with a white material, except transparent surfaces which become grey. Great for shadow studies.

##Edges

- **Edges:** Display edges on the model.
- **Contrast:** Adjust the relative visibility of edges against model surfaces.
- **Thick Edges:** Display thickened edges.
- **Sketchy Edges:** Display edges with a sketch-like effect.
- **Hidden Edges:** Display edges behind surfaces for a wireframe effect.
- **Extended Edges:** Draw a slight extension to edges for a sketch-like effect.
- **Silhouettes:** Display thicker lines around perimeters of objects to emphasize form.
- **Silhouette Contrast:** Adjust the relative visibility of silhouette edges against model surfaces.

##Environment

- **Grid:** Display the grid on the ground.
- **Ground Plane:** Display the colored opaque effect on the ground.
- **Axes:** Display the XYZ axes indicators at the origin.
- **North Arrow:** Display a helpful north arrow indicator in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
- **Levels:** Display levels on objects that have Levels enabled in the Properties palette.

##Diagnostics

- **Identify Watertight Issues:** Highlight non-manifold edges in a red color to help clean up models for sending to other applications, and for identifying potential model fidelity issues.
- **Identify Back Faces:** Highlight faces that are reversed to help clean up models for sending to other applications, and for identifying potential model fidelity issues.
- **Show Group Bounding Boxes:** Draw bounding boxes for all Groups and nested Groups in the sketch.
- **Show Default Color on back Faces:** Checking this overrides any faces that may have a back face material with the default FormIt color.
