# Visual Styles

Visual Styles provides a one-stop shop for tweaking the display of model surfaces, edges, and its environment. Visual Styles also provides options for toggling helpful diagnostic options.

##Surfaces

- **Shadows:** Display shadows based on sketch location and selected time of day.
- **Ambient Shadows:** Display soft shadows for an added touch of realism.
- ** Monotone Surfaces:** Display all surfaces with a white material, except transparent surfaces which become grey. Great for shadow studies.

#Edges

- **Edges:** Display edges on the model.
- **Contrast:** Adjust the relative visibility of edges against model surfaces.
- **Thick Edges:** Display thickened edges.
- **Sketchy Edges:** Display edges with a sketch-like effect.
- **Hidden Edges:** Display edges behind surfaces for a wireframe effect.
- **Extended Edges:** Draw a slight extension to edges for a sketch-like effect.
- **Silhouettes:** Display thicker lines around perimeters of objects to emphasize form.
- **Silhouette Contrast:** Adjust the relative visibility of silhouette edges against model surfaces.

#Diagnostics

*Display edges*: Toggle this feature to turn off edges in your model. This option works well with Ambient shadows for presentations<br>* *Display silhouette outlines*: Forms will be emphasized by drawing a slightly wider line around the silhouette edges<br>* *Display wide lines*: Widest lines possible<br>* *Display sketchy lines*: Change the appearance of your sketch by toggling making lines to appear that they have been sketched by hand<br>* *Show hidden lines*: Display faint lines that are normally hidden by other faces<br>* *Display extended edges*: Display short extensions where lines intersect<br>* *Display grid*: Toggle the visibility of the grid<br>* *Display axes: *Toggle the visibility of the coordinate system axes<br>* *Display north arrow: *Toggle the visibility of the north arrow<br>* *Display levels*: Toggle the visibility of the levels<br><br>  |
