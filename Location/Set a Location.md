# Set a Location

Click the Location icon ![](Images/GUID-45268F36-37CA-468C-B326-9DB28FFA5534-low.png)  from the main toolbar. You can either search for a specific location or use the map to browse for a location. 
    
You can also move the red pin to another location on the map. When ready, click 'Set Location only.'

This action will return you to the drawing area and set the location of the project without importing the satellite image. You can always return later to the Location screen [import the satellite image](../Location/Import a Satellite Image.md).
