# Modify Designs

Make designs more complex by using a variety of geometry modification tools.

After you select an object \(solid, face, edge, point\), you can manipulate objects using a variety of operations including Move, Delete, Extrude, Offset, Tilt, Scale, Rotate, Array, and Boolean operations like Union and Subtract.
