# Welcome to Autodesk FormIt and FormIt Pro

Discover how to create conceptual building designs while initiating a BIM workflow.

Use Autodesk® FormIt® to capture building design concepts when ideas occur. Create those ideas in a portable digital format that can use real-world site information, such as satellite images, to orient your designs. Use real building and environmental data to support design brainstorming. Move your preliminary designs to centralized data storage for access and refinement in Autodesk® Revit® software or other applications.

[Autodesk® FormIt® Pro](http://www.autodesk.com/store/formit-360?licenseType=cloudSub&term=monthly) provides additional features, including: Solar Analysis, Energy Analysis, Realtime Collaboration, Autodesk Material Library, and access to the FormIt for Windows application.
