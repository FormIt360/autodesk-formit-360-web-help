# Set a Location

Click the Location icon ![](../.gitbook/assets/guid-45268f36-37ca-468c-b326-9db28ffa5534-low.png) from the main toolbar. You can either search for a specific location or use the map to browse for a location.

You can also move the red pin to another location on the map. When ready, click 'Set Location only.'
