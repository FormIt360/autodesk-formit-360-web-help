# Location

To accurately analyze your designs, you should define the geographic location of your sketch using the Location feature. Setting the location is important when you want to use Building Performance data while designing. See[ Building Performance](https://github.com/formit3d/autodesk-formit-360-web-help/tree/b94092a615fd6c673021a2b2f7cc67dcd4ba45ce/Building%20Performance/README.md) for more details.
