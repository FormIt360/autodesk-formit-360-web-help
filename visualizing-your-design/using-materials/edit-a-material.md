   * _Color_: When a material has both texture and color, the two are multiplied together.
   * _Bump_: Load a texture to apply bumpiness based on the image.
   * _Cutout_: Load a black and white bitmap. The white areas will appear solid and the black areas will be transparent.
   * _Opacity_: A higher value means the material will be more transparent.
   * _Gloss_: A higher value will add a shiny gloss effect to the material.
   * _Reflection Direct_: A higher value will increase the amount of reflectivity visible when looking directly at a face.
   * _Reflection: Oblique_: A higher value will increase the amount of reflectivity visible when looking at a face from an oblique angle.
5. Click OK to save the changes to the material.
